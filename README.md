# Professional Porfolio
## Portfolio Overview
This portfolio is built using many programming technologies including:
+ Javascript
+ JQuery
+ Node.js
+ APIs
+ HTML
+ CSS
+ Bootstrap
+ Ajax
The index landing page is organized into three collapsable sections:
1. About Me
2. Portfolio
3. Contact
All of these sections can be active together or inactive in any combination.\
In an impending update, I plan on saving the status of open/unopen in a cookie\
so that the program remembers what was last left up.\
This is particularly useful when viewing the portfolio, as returning from portfolio pages\
Sends the index back to its initial, blank value.

## About Me
This section contains my brief brand statement.

## Portfolio
![Project Options]()
This section links to all my published gitpage projects. By clicking on a card,\
users are brought into that deployed version of that project.

##Contact

It is currently in an unfinished and nonfunctional state.
