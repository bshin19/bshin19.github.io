# Professional Porfolio

## Portfolio Overview

This portfolio is built using many programming technologies including:

- Javascript
- JQuery

- Typewriter API

Each project incorporates the above as a baseline as well as a wide array of other technologies such as:

- Node.js
- A wide array of node modules
- APIs
- SQL
- Mongodb
- Firebase
- Ajax
- RESTful
- and the Agile workflow

The index landing page is organized into three collapsable sections:

1. About Me
2. Portfolio
3. Contact

All of these sections can be active together or inactive in any combination.\
In an impending update, the status of open/unopen will be saved in a cookie\
so that the program remembers what was last left up.\
This is particularly useful when viewing the portfolio, as returning from portfolio pages\
Sends the index back to its initial, blank value.

## Body

[Body](https://github.com/bshin19/bshin19.github.io/blob/master/global_assets/images/typewriter.gif)
I styled this page by taking the default color values from Visual Studio for all the custom content, while the descending number line was created from a screenshot of Visual Studio. A typewriter API is utilized and interacts with a random string from a list to cycle through phrases. It stalls this process whenever a section is opened or close to display a specific string instead of a random string.
